As my friend, Mr Sherlock Holmes, entered the shop, his deep-seated, keen eyes immediately perceived that a man had hanged himself from a hook in the ceiling. Following after him, I had the fact pointed out to me.

"This case is of course lucid, but it does have some interesting features," remarked Holmes.

"How do you mean?"

"Watson, I really would be at a loss what to do without you! Your predictability is like the Rock of Gibraltar. Now, you do see that this man's shoes have been newly blackened?"

"Yes."

"Furthermore, I notice that he has stood an excellent, fastidiously rolled umbrella against the counter, as if waiting for the proprietor to turn up."

"Yes. Where is the proprietor, by the way?"

"Really, Watson, I should have thought even you realized that the proprietor's whereabouts has no bearing on to the case."

I apologized.

"Your apology is accepted, Watson. Have you noticed the strange, flat object that adorns the floor under the unfortunate man's shoes?"

I bent down and took up the object in question.
